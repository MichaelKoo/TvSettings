/**
 * This filter will constrain edits so that the text length is not
 * greater than the specified number of bytes using UTF-8 encoding.
 * <p>The JNI method used by {@link android.server.BluetoothService}
 * to convert UTF-16 to UTF-8 doesn't support surrogate pairs,
 * therefore code points outside of the basic multilingual plane
 * (0000-FFFF) will be encoded as a pair of 3-byte UTF-8 characters,
 * rather than a single 4-byte UTF-8 encoding. Dalvik implements this
 * conversion in {@code convertUtf16ToUtf8()} in
 * {@code dalvik/vm/UtfString.c}.
 * <p>This JNI method is unlikely to change in the future due to
 * backwards compatibility requirements. It's also unclear whether
 * the installed base of Bluetooth devices would correctly handle the
 * encoding of surrogate pairs in UTF-8 as 4 bytes rather than 6.
 * However, this filter will still work in scenarios where surrogate
 * pairs are encoded as 4 bytes, with the caveat that the maximum
 * length will be constrained more conservatively than necessary.
